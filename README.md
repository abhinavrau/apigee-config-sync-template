# apigee-config-sync-template

Template repo to use Anthos Config Sync with Apigee

See this [gist](https://gist.github.com/abhinavrau/16e44d02bb8f7587d0919518bbfe0027) for a script that does the magic of taking the apigee override.yaml file and converting it to the format that Anthos ConfigSync requires.
